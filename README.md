## Inventory of Cards

If you are printing this game yourself, you will need to print three copies of each of the Code card pages and two copies of the Action and Feature pages. Print the appropriate backs on each page. Only one copy of the Meta page is required. For best results, print on heavy cardstock and use the crop lines and a rotary cutter to trim the cards down to standard playing card size (2.5" x 3.5").

- Code Cards — Three each, for every combination of language and shape:
    - C++

    - Python
    - Ruby

    - Bug (x8) "Play on a specific code card another player’s commit. This commit has a bug and must be discarded."
    - git blame (x4) "You can use blame any time a “Bug” card is played against you. That bug must be passed to another player of your choosing. If no players have active commits, the bug is discarded."
    - git bisect (x2) "You can use bisect any time a "Bug" card is played against you. Bisect quickly finds the source of the bug, counteracting the "Bug" card's action."
    - git rebase (x4) "Use rebase to move your token to the tip of the code commits in Master."
    - Caffeine | All-Nighter (x4) "Commit one extra code card."
    - RTFM - I read the docs! (x2) "This card acts as a commit of any language. It will not cause any merge conflicts."
